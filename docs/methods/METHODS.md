# METHODS

## Core Philosophy
Yukti enforces explicit statistical assumptions, operator-faithful computation, and post-hoc visualization only.

## Statistical Inference
All tests require declared data types, assumptions, and correction strategies prior to execution.

## Spatial & Spatio-temporal Analysis
Operators are discretization-aware (grid / graph) with explicit opt-in for temporal or spatial reasoning.

## Benchmarks & Validation
Each method is benchmarked against canonical or published references with tolerance-based acceptance.

## Visualization
Plots consume frozen results only and support p-value annotations, effect sizes, and uncertainty overlays.

## Reproducibility
All computations are deterministic, versioned, and audit-logged in UTC.
