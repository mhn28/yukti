# Yukti

**Yukti** is an open-source scientific inference platform focused on
reasoned statistical interpretation, validation, and epistemic clarity.

The name *Yukti* (Sanskrit: युक्ति) denotes justified, context-aware reasoning
used when direct observation or simple deduction is insufficient.

This project emphasizes:
- statistical rigor
- reproducibility
- transparency
- human-verifiable inference

Status: early foundation (pre-GUI)
